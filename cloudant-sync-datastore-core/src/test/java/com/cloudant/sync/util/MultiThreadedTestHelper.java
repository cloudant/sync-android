/**
 * A simple test abstraction that executes a callable from the specified number of threads as close
 * to simultaneously as possible. The callable is wrapped in a runnable and blocked behind a latch.
 * The latch counts down as each thread is ready and then there is a final countdown to unlatch all
 * the threads at once.
 * <p>
 * To use this class extend it specifying the number of threads and implementing getCallable.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The default assertions include checking that all the threads executed and there were no
 * exceptions and that the number of results were correct. Additional assertions are added by
 * implementing the doAssertions method.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Call run to start the test.

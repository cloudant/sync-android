/**
 * <p>
 * Annotation to indicate a method should be subscribed to events posted to the {@link EventBus} on
 * which the method's owning instance is registered.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Methods using this annotation must have only a single parameter and must be visible to the
 * EventBus (i.e. the owning class and method itself must be public). The parameter type of the
 * annotated method is of the type of event that notifications will be received for.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Subscribers are called synchronously so methods using this annotation must not perform long
 * running operations and should spawn a separate thread if needed.

/**
 * <p>
 * Strategy to decide whether to push attachments inline:
 * </p>
 *
 * <ul>
 *     <li>False: Always push attachments separately from JSON body, via multipart/related</li>
 *     <li>Small: Push small attachments inline, and large attachments separately.
 *         Uses SavedAttachment.isLarge() to determine whether attachment is small or large.</li>
 *     <li>True: Always push attachments inline in JSON body, as a base64-encoded string.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * Note that all attachments belonging to a pushed revision are either sent via multipart/related,
 * or all inline in JSON body, as a base64-encoded string.
 * Further details of this can be found at
 * {@link RevisionHistoryHelper#shouldInline(Map, PushAttachmentsInline, int)}

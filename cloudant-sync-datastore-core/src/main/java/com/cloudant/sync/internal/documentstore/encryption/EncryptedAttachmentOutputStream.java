/**
 * <p>An EncryptedAttachmentOutputStream handles writing AES encrypted data to disk,
 * combining the encrypted data with a header specifying the IV used during encryption.
 * A CipherOutputStream is used to encrypt the data sent via write() methods.</p>
 *
 * <p>This class adheres strictly to the semantics, especially the failure semantics,
 * of its ancestor classes java.io.OutputStream and java.io.FilterOutputStream. This class
 * has exactly those methods specified in its ancestor classes, and overrides them all.
 * Moreover, this class catches all exceptions that are not thrown by its ancestor classes.</p>
 *
 * <p>It is crucial for a programmer using this class not to use methods that are not
 * defined or overriden in this class (such as a new method or constructor that is later
 * added to one of the super classes), because the design and implementation of those
 * methods are unlikely to have considered security impact with regard to the underlying
 * CipherOutputStream.</p>
 *
 * <p>The data format written by this class is read by EncryptedAttachmentInputStream, and
 * is:</p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * Header:
 * 1-byte : version number, 1
 * 16-byte: initialisation vector
 *
 * Body:
 * AES CBC Encrypted file content.
 * </pre>

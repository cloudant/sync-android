/**
 * <p>
 * A class for writing MIME Multipart/Related (RFC 2387) streams to CouchDB.
 * Used to send attachments inline with document revisions without incurring the overhead of base64
 * encoding.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Use as follows:
 * </p>
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * DocumentRevision myDocument;
 * List<Attachment> myAttachments;
 * CouchClient myClient;
 * ...
 * MultipartAttachmentWriter mpw = new MultipartAttachmentWriter();
 * mpw.setRequestBody(myDocument);
 * for (Attachment a : myAttachments) {
 *     mpw.addAttachment(a);
 * }
 * // don't forget to call close when we're done adding attachments
 * mpw.close();
 * // do a PUT to couch
 * myClient.putMultipart(mpw);
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * The stream consists of a first MIME body which is the JSON document itself, which needs to have
 * the <code>_attachments</code> object correctly populated. This is currently done by
 * {@link RevisionHistoryHelper#addAttachments(Map, Map, boolean, int)}
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Attachments which are included in subsequent MIME bodies should have <code>follows</code> set to
 * <code>true</code> in the <code>_attachments</code> object.
 * </p>
 *

/**
 * <p>An EncryptedAttachmentInputStream handles reading AES encrypted data from disk,
 * first reading the attachment file's header to determine the IV and checking the
 * on-disk version is readable.
 * A CipherInputStream is used to decrypt the data read via read() methods.</p>
 *
 * <p>This class adheres strictly to the semantics, especially the failure semantics, of its
 * ancestor classes java.io.FilterInputStream and java.io.InputStream. This class has exactly
 * those methods specified in its ancestor classes, and overrides them all. Moreover, this
 * class catches all exceptions that are not thrown by its ancestor classes. In particular,
 * the skip method skips, and the available method counts only data that have been processed
 * by the encapsulated Cipher.</p>
 *
 * <p>It is crucial for a programmer using this class not to use methods that are not defined
 * or overriden in this class (such as a new method or constructor that is later added to
 * one of the super classes), because the design and implementation of those methods are
 * unlikely to have considered security impact with regard to CipherInputStream.</p>
 *
 * <p>The data format read by this class is written by EncryptedAttachmentOutputStream, and
 * is:</p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * Header:
 * 1-byte : version number, 1
 * 16-byte: initialisation vector
 *
 * Body:
 * AES CBC Encrypted file content.
 * </pre>

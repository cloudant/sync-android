     * <p>This method inserts a revision into the document tree for an existing
     * document. It checks every revision in the revision history, and adds
     * {@code rev} is it isn't already present in the datastore.</p>
     *
     * <p>Here is an example of revHistory:</p>
     *

     * ]
     * </pre>
     *
     * <p>This method should only be called by the replicator. It's designed
     * to allow revisions from different datastores to be added to this
     * datastore during the replication process, when we wouldn't want to
     * create new revision IDs (as if we did, we wouldn't know that we already
     * had a particular revision from a previous replication).</p>
     *
     * <p>The {@code revisionHistory} is required so that we know whether
     * the {@code rev} is part of the existing document tree, so we can see
     * whether it's a conflict which needs to be grafted to the tree or
     * whether it's a newer version of the same branch we already have.</p>
     *
     * <p>If the document was successfully inserted, a
     * {@link com.cloudant.sync.notifications.DocumentCreated DocumentCreated},
     * {@link com.cloudant.sync.notifications.DocumentModified DocumentModified}, or
     * {@link com.cloudant.sync.notifications.DocumentDeleted DocumentDeleted}

     * of the update made.</p>

     *            from a remote datastore.
     * @param revisionHistory The history of the revision being inserted,
     *                        including the rev ID of {@code rev}. This list
     *                        needs to be sorted in ascending order.

# Replication with Cloudant Sync Android

_This functionality is available in versions 0.3.3 and up._

Replication is used to synchronise data between the local datastore and a
remote database, either a CouchDB instance or a Cloudant database. Many
datastores can replicate with the same remote database, meaning that
cross-device synchronisation is achieved by setting up replications from each
device to the remote database.

## Replication Scenarios

Replication is a flexible system for copying data between local and remote
databases. Each replication is in a single direction, copying differences either
from a local database to a remote database or a remote database to a local
database.

Often, a single local and remote database will be kept synchronised with each
other. For example, all a user's notes synchronised between a web application
and a device-based application. To fully synchronise data between two databases,
run a push *and* a pull replication. These can be run concurrently.

Replication is not limited to a single pair of databases. If a user has several
devices, it's simple to set up replications between each device and a central
remote database to synchronise data between devices.

Less commonly but just as tenable, data can be sent from a single local
database to several remote databases:

A final diagram shows how to replicate databases on the local
device with several different remote databases, even if they are on different
servers.

Overall, replication is very flexible and can be set up in many topologies.
In particular, many scenarios might only require a push or a pull replication:

* A data collection application might only need to use a push replication to
  replicate data from the device to a remote database -- there's no need for
  synchronisation and therefore no corresponding pull replication.
* If only a local data cache is required, using only a pull replication will
  keep local data up to date with remote data.

### Setting Up For Sync

Currently, the replication process requires a remote database to exist already.
To avoid exposing credentials for the remote system on each device, we recommend
creating a web service to authenticate users and set up databases for client
devices. This web service needs to:

* Handle sign in/sign up for users.
* Create a new remote database for a new user.
* Grant access to the new database for the new device (e.g., via [API keys][keys]
  on Cloudant or the `_users` database in CouchDB).
* Return the database URL and credentials to the device.

### Replication on the Device

From the device side, replication is straightforward. You can replicate from a
local datastore to a remote database, from a remote database to a local
datastore, or both ways to implement synchronisation.

Replications are set up in code on a device. Use `ReplicatorBuilder` to create
a pre-configured `Replicator` object. Each `Replicator`
object can be assigned a `Listener` to receive message when replication
completes or encounters an error.

First we create a simple listener that just sets a CountDownLatch when the
replication finishes so we can wait for a replication to finish without
needing to poll:

```java
import com.cloudant.sync.event.Subscribe;
import java.util.concurrent.CountDownLatch;
import com.cloudant.sync.event.notifications.ReplicationCompleted;
import com.cloudant.sync.event.notifications.ReplicationErrored;
import com.cloudant.sync.replication.ErrorInfo;

/**
 * A {@code ReplicationListener} that sets a latch when it's told the
 * replication has finished.
 */
private class Listener {

    private final CountDownLatch latch;
    public ErrorInfo error = null;
    public int documentsReplicated;
    public int batchesReplicated;

    Listener(CountDownLatch latch) {
        this.latch = latch;
    }

    @Subscribe
    public void complete(ReplicationCompleted event) {
        this.documentsReplicated = event.documentsReplicated;
        this.batchesReplicated = event.batchesReplicated;
        latch.countDown();
    }

    @Subscribe
    public void error(ReplicationErrored event) {
        this.error = event.errorInfo;
        latch.countDown();
    }
}
```

Next we replicate a local datastore to a remote database:

```java
import com.cloudant.sync.replication.ReplicatorBuilder;
import com.cloudant.sync.replication.Replicator;

// Username/password are supplied in the URL and can be Cloudant API keys
URI uri = new URI("https://username:password@username.cloudant.com/my_database");

Datastore ds = manager.openDatastore("my_datastore");

// Create a replicator that replicates changes from the local
// datastore to the remote database.
Replicator replicator = ReplicatorBuilder.push().to(uri).from(ds).build();

// Use a CountDownLatch to provide a lightweight way to wait for completion
CountDownLatch latch = new CountDownLatch(1);
Listener listener = new Listener(latch);
replicator.getEventBus().register(listener);
replicator.start();
latch.await();
replicator.getEventBus().unregister(listener);
if (replicator.getState() != Replicator.State.COMPLETE) {
    System.out.println("Error replicating TO remote");
    System.out.println(listener.error);
} else {
    System.out.println(String.format("Replicated %d documents in %d batches",
            listener.documentsReplicated, listener.batchesReplicated));
}
```

And getting data from a remote database to a local one:

```java
// Username/password are supplied in the URL and can be Cloudant API keys
URI uri = new URI("https://username:password@username.cloudant.com/my_database");

Datastore ds = manager.openDatastore("my_datastore");

// Create a replicator that replicates changes from the remote
// database to the local datastore.
Replicator replicator = ReplicatorBuilder.pull().from(uri).to(ds).build();

// Use a CountDownLatch to provide a lightweight way to wait for completion
CountDownLatch latch = new CountDownLatch(1);
Listener listener = new Listener(latch);
replicator.getEventBus().register(listener);
replicator.start();
latch.await();
replicator.getEventBus().unregister(listener);
if (replicator.getState() != Replicator.State.COMPLETE) {
    System.out.println("Error replicating FROM remote");
    System.out.println(listener.error);
}
```

And running a full sync, that is, two one way replications:

```java

// Username/password are supplied in the URL and can be Cloudant API keys
URI uri = new URI("https://username:password@username.cloudant.com/my_database");

Datastore ds = manager.openDatastore("my_datastore");

// Create the pull replicator
Replicator pullReplicator = ReplicatorBuilder.pull().from(uri).to(ds).build();

// Create the push replicator
Replicator pushReplicator = ReplicationBuilder.push().to(uri).from(ds).build();

// Use a latch starting at 2 as we're waiting for two replications to finish
latch = new CountDownLatch(2);
Listener listener = new Listener(latch);

// Set the listener and start for both pull and push replications
pullReplicator.getEventBus().register(listener);
pullReplicator.start();
pushReplicator.getEventBus().register(listener);
pushReplicator.start();

// Wait for both replications to complete, decreasing the latch via listeners
latch.await();

// Unsubscribe the listeners
pullReplicator.getEventBus().unregister(listener);
pushReplicator.getEventBus().unregister(listener);

// Unfortunately in this implementation we'll only record the last error
// the listener saw
if (pullReplicator.getState() != Replicator.State.COMPLETE) {
    System.out.println("Error replicating FROM remote");
    System.out.println(listener.error);
}
if (pushReplicator.getState() != Replicator.State.COMPLETE) {
    System.out.println("Error replicating TO remote");
    System.out.println(listener.error);
}
```

### Using IndexManager with replication

When using IndexManager for querying data, we recommend you update after
replication completes to avoid a wait for indexing to catch up when the new data
is first queried:

```java
import com.cloudant.sync.replication.ReplicatorBuilder;
import com.cloudant.sync.replication.Replicator;
import com.cloudant.sync.query.IndexManager;

// username/password can be Cloudant API keys
URI uri = new URI("https://username:password@username.cloudant.com/my_database");

Datastore ds = manager.openDatastore("my_datastore");

// Create a replicator that replicates changes from the remote
// database to the local datastore.
PullReplication pull = new PullReplication();
pull.source = uri;
pull.target = ds;
Replicator replicator = ReplicatorBuilder.pull().from(uri).to(ds).build();

// Create a sample index on type field
IndexManager indexManager = new IndexManager(ds);
indexManager.ensureIndexed(Arrays.asList("fieldName"), "indexName");

// Use a CountDownLatch to provide a lightweight way to wait for completion
latch = new CountDownLatch(1);
Listener listener = new Listener(latch);
replicator.getEventBus().register(listener);
replicator.start();
latch.await();
replicator.getEventBus().unregister(listener);
if (replicator.getState() != Replicator.State.COMPLETE) {
    System.out.println("Error replicating TO remote");
    System.out.println(listener.error);
}

// Ensure all indexes are updated after replication
indexManager.updateAllIndexes();

```

### Filtered pull replication

[Filtered replication][1] is only supported for pull replication. It requires a
`PullFilter` to be added to the `ReplicatorBuilder` object. A `PullFilter` describes
the _Filter Function_ that is used and its query parameters.

```java
import com.cloudant.sync.replication.ReplicatorBuilder;
import com.cloudant.sync.replication.Replicator;
import com.cloudant.sync.replication.PullFilter;


Map<String, String> parameters = new HashMap<String, String>();
parameters.put("key", "value");
PullFilter filter = new PullFilter("filterDoc/filterFunctionName", parameters);
Replicator replicator = ReplicatorBuilder.pull()
                        .from(this.getURI())
                        .to(this.datastore)
                        .filter(filter)
                        .build();
```

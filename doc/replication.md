# Replication with Cloudant Sync Android

Replication is used to synchronise data between the local document store and a
remote database, either a CouchDB instance or a Cloudant database. Many
document stores can replicate with the same remote database, meaning that
cross-device synchronisation is achieved by setting up replications from each
device to the remote database.

## Replication Scenarios

Replication is a flexible system for copying data between local and remote
databases. Each replication is in a single direction, copying differences either
from a local database to a remote database or a remote database to a local
database.

Often, a single local and remote database will be kept synchronised with each
other. For example, all a user's notes synchronised between a web application
and a device-based application. To fully synchronise data between two databases,
run a push *and* a pull replication. These can be run concurrently.

Replication is not limited to a single pair of databases. If a user has several
devices, it's simple to set up replications between each device and a central
remote database to synchronise data between devices.

Less commonly but just as tenable, data can be sent from a single local
database to several remote databases:

A final diagram shows how to replicate databases on the local
device with several different remote databases, even if they are on different
servers.

Overall, replication is very flexible and can be set up in many topologies.
In particular, many scenarios might only require a push or a pull replication:

* A data collection application might only need to use a push replication to
  replicate data from the device to a remote database -- there's no need for
  synchronisation and therefore no corresponding pull replication.
* If only a local data cache is required, using only a pull replication will
  keep local data up to date with remote data.

### Setting Up For Sync

Currently, the replication process requires a remote database to exist already.
To avoid exposing credentials for the remote system on each device, we recommend
creating a web service to authenticate users and set up databases for client
devices. This web service needs to:

* Handle sign in/sign up for users.
* Create a new remote database for a new user.
* Grant access to the new database for the new device (e.g., via [API keys][keys]
  on Cloudant or the `_users` database in CouchDB).
* Return the database URL and credentials to the device.

### Replication on the Device

From the device side, replication is straightforward. You can replicate from a
local document store to a remote database, from a remote database to a local
document store, or both ways to implement synchronisation.

Replications are set up in code on a device. Use `ReplicatorBuilder` to create
a pre-configured `Replicator` object. Each `Replicator`
object can be assigned a `Listener` to receive message when replication
completes or encounters an error.

The replication examples below are 'one-shot' and will run once until
completion, at which point the local and remote databases will be
synchronised. [Replication policies](replication-policies.md) allow
for more complex "policies" to be executed, eg "only replicate when on
Wifi" or "replicate every 30 minutes".

First we create a simple listener that just sets a CountDownLatch when the
replication finishes so we can wait for a replication to finish without
needing to poll:

```java
/**
 * A {@code ReplicationListener} that sets a latch when it's told the
 * replication has finished.
 */
private class Listener {

    private final CountDownLatch latch;
    public List<Throwable> errors = new ArrayList<Throwable>();
    public int documentsReplicated = 0;
    public int batchesReplicated = 0;

    Listener(CountDownLatch latch) {
        this.latch = latch;
    }

    @Subscribe
    public void complete(ReplicationCompleted event) {
        this.documentsReplicated += event.documentsReplicated;
        this.batchesReplicated += event.batchesReplicated;
        latch.countDown();
    }

    @Subscribe
    public void error(ReplicationErrored event) {
        this.errors.add(event.errorInfo);
        latch.countDown();
    }
}
```

Next we replicate a local document store to a remote database:

```java
// Username/password are supplied in the URL and can be Cloudant API keys
URI uri = new URI("https://username:password@username.cloudant.com/my_database");

DocumentStore ds = DocumentStore.getInstance(new File("my_datastore"));

// Create a replicator that replicates changes from the local
// datastore to the remote database.
Replicator replicator = ReplicatorBuilder.push().to(uri).from(ds).build();

// Use a CountDownLatch to provide a lightweight way to wait for completion
CountDownLatch latch = new CountDownLatch(1);
Listener listener = new Listener(latch);
replicator.getEventBus().register(listener);
replicator.start();
latch.await();
replicator.getEventBus().unregister(listener);
if (replicator.getState() != Replicator.State.COMPLETE) {
    System.err.println("Error replicating TO remote");
    System.err.println(listener.errors);
} else {
    System.out.println(String.format("Replicated %d documents in %d batches",
            listener.documentsReplicated, listener.batchesReplicated));
}
```

And getting data from a remote database to a local one:

```java
// Username/password are supplied in the URL and can be Cloudant API keys
URI uri = new URI("https://username:password@username.cloudant.com/my_database");

DocumentStore ds = DocumentStore.getInstance(new File("my_datastore"));

// Create a replicator that replicates changes from the remote
// database to the local datastore.
Replicator replicator = ReplicatorBuilder.pull().from(uri).to(ds).build();

// Use a CountDownLatch to provide a lightweight way to wait for completion
CountDownLatch latch = new CountDownLatch(1);
Listener listener = new Listener(latch);
replicator.getEventBus().register(listener);
replicator.start();
latch.await();
replicator.getEventBus().unregister(listener);
if (replicator.getState() != Replicator.State.COMPLETE) {
    System.err.println("Error replicating FROM remote");
    System.err.println(listener.errors);
} else {
    System.out.println(String.format("Replicated %d documents in %d batches",
            listener.documentsReplicated, listener.batchesReplicated));
}
```

And running a full sync, that is, two one way replications:

```java

// Username/password are supplied in the URL and can be Cloudant API keys
URI uri = new URI("https://username:password@username.cloudant.com/my_database");

DocumentStore ds = DocumentStore.getInstance(new File("my_datastore"));

// Create the pull replicator
Replicator pullReplicator = ReplicatorBuilder.pull().from(uri).to(ds).build();

// Create the push replicator
Replicator pushReplicator = ReplicatorBuilder.push().to(uri).from(ds).build();

// Use a latch starting at 2 as we're waiting for two replications to finish
CountDownLatch latch = new CountDownLatch(2);
Listener listener = new Listener(latch);

// Set the listener and start for both pull and push replications
pullReplicator.getEventBus().register(listener);
pullReplicator.start();
pushReplicator.getEventBus().register(listener);
pushReplicator.start();

// Wait for both replications to complete, decreasing the latch via listeners
latch.await();

// Unsubscribe the listeners
pullReplicator.getEventBus().unregister(listener);
pushReplicator.getEventBus().unregister(listener);

if (pullReplicator.getState() != Replicator.State.COMPLETE) {
    System.err.println("Error replicating FROM remote");
    System.err.println(listener.errors);
} else if (pushReplicator.getState() != Replicator.State.COMPLETE) {
    System.err.println("Error replicating TO remote");
    System.err.println(listener.errors);
} else {
    System.out.println(String.format("Replicated %d documents in %d batches",
            listener.documentsReplicated, listener.batchesReplicated));
}
```

### Using IndexManager with replication

When using IndexManager for querying data, we recommend you update after
replication completes to avoid a wait for indexing to catch up when the new data
is first queried:

```java
// username/password can be Cloudant API keys
URI uri = new URI("https://username:password@username.cloudant.com/my_database");

DocumentStore ds = DocumentStore.getInstance(new File("my_datastore"));

// Create a replicator that replicates changes from the remote
// database to the local datastore.
Replicator replicator = ReplicatorBuilder.pull().from(uri).to(ds).build();

// Create a sample index on type field
ds.query().ensureIndexed(Arrays.asList(new FieldSort("fieldName")), "indexName");

// Use a CountDownLatch to provide a lightweight way to wait for completion
CountDownLatch latch = new CountDownLatch(1);
Listener listener = new Listener(latch);
replicator.getEventBus().register(listener);
replicator.start();
latch.await();
replicator.getEventBus().unregister(listener);
if (replicator.getState() != Replicator.State.COMPLETE) {
    System.out.println("Error replicating TO remote");
    System.out.println(listener.errors);
}

// Ensure all indexes are updated after replication
ds.query().updateAllIndexes();

```

### Filtered pull replication

[Filtered replication][1] is only supported for pull replication. It requires a
`PullFilter` to be added to the `ReplicatorBuilder` object. A `PullFilter` describes
the _Filter Function_ that is used and its query parameters.

```java
Map<String, String> parameters = new HashMap<String, String>();
parameters.put("key", "value");
PullFilter filter = new PullFilter("filterDoc/filterFunctionName", parameters);
Replicator replicator = ReplicatorBuilder.pull()
                        .from(uri))
                        .to(ds)
                        .filter(filter)
                        .build();
```
